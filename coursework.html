								<p> In my Modeling and Simulation course, I abstracted many systems through programming them in Python and used those models to predict outcomes when different variables are applied.  </p>
								<p>For this project, I analyzed the rate of alcohol dissolving and dissipating into the bloodstream. I then swept the number of drinks consumed and modeled how that impacts the blood alcohol content (BAC). My model can be used to predict when someone will be ok to drive after they have had a certain number of drinks.</p>

													  <p> This is a bio-inspired hopper. It was designed to make learning about anatomy fun for kids though a well labeled, hopping, educational tool.
															Kids will jump with the hopper and use kinesthetic learning to discover more about how their body is able to jumps.


<p>I want kids to understand how the different muscles in their own legs are work when they jump with the hopper. When I was
a kid I was terrified to learn about anatomy and what goes on inside myself. Through this project, I was able to move past those fears and I studied
many anatomical sketches and pictures. I realized that it was not the blood and bones that I was afraid of, but the
correlation that the knowledge was mostly gather from dead cadavers. My end result will be an educational tool that I would not
have been afraid of as a child. Jumping with the hopper instills a more lively, positive tone and makes learning about anatomy
less frightening. I hope that this tool can help other kids see the importance about learning how your body works as a
living, moving system.</p>

							<p>For my Innovation Studio class and engineering capstone project in high school, I took on the endeavor to research and implement ways to improve my school’s library and makerspace. To conduct research for this project I interviewed students, teachers and administration as stakeholders and closely read and annotated the book Make Space to find solutions that would work well in our community. I then narrowed down the project to three major components: signage, furniture and storage. I also focused on documentation for this project and kept avid notes on each stage of the project. </p>
							<a class="image featured"><img src="images/makerspace.jpg" style="width:100%"></a>
							<p>Signage – I designed vinyl stickers that would differentiate the Makerspace from the rest of the library and visually explain some features of the Makerspace. I also developed an inventory system to document what supplies we had in the Makerspace and established safety/supervision ratings for the tools.</p>
							<a class="image featured"><img src="images/backwall.jpg" style="width:100%"></a>
							<p>Furniture – My teammate Jenna and I worked with administration to develop a proposal for new library furniture that is modular, able to be adjusted for the many different uses of the library, and is more accessible to students with disabilities. This was important as the prior tables were cumbersome, bulky, and not ADA compliant.  Our solution involved ordering a variety of semi-circle and rectangular folding tables that could be rearranged or put away for the many different functions of the library.</p>
							<a class="image featured"><img src="images/shelf.png" style="width:100%"></a>
							<p>Storage – To store and feature all of the cool projects students can create in the Makerspace, Jenna and I designed and built a large rolling cabinet for the space. The cabinet can hold 12 milkcrates which can hold the materials needed for a student to get started on a project. It can also be used to display the different creations that students make in the space and inspire others to create and innovate as well.</p>

							<p>For my Writing Fellows class, I researched the design process and created an activity packet to guide in the documentation process. I designed this packet specifically to be used in the product design and engineering courses at my school as often the students would not see the importance of the design process and jump ahead to the manufacturing process before they knew what they were building. The packet gives the students a variety of different work pages to explore their design and refine their ideas. </p>

								<p> In Product Design I created a desk organizer for my office supplies. First, I created a 3D model of my design using Inventor. I used finger joints to hold the sides together and dado joints to slide the shelves in. </p>
								<p>Then I used a CNC router to cut out each of the pieces. Finally, I assembled the pieces together and painted the finished product.</p>
